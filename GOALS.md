Goals & Assumptions
===================

Empire V is an exercise in modern software engineering and
design.  It's based on the well documented behavior of [Empire 4](http://www.wolfpackempire.com).

## Goals
The goal of Empire V are:

  1.  Thoroughly and properly design Empire V:
      - Assumptions & Goals
      - **Conceptual:**  Entities and their relationships
      - **Specification:**  Expose the ADTs
      - **Implementation**

  2.  To apply the best practices of modern software engineering

  3.  Major design decisions are discussed including:
      - Alternative approaches
      - Pros and cons
      - Mitigations
      - Triggers for reevaluation


## Assumptions
- Lots of memory
- Multicore CPU
- Fast, reliable network
