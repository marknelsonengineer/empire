### Documentation
One of the design goals is to make sure Empire is well documented and that the 
thinking behind major design decisions were written down.  To that end, Empire's
documentation can be found here:

#### Player Documentation
Someday, when we have players, we'll add links here.

#### Deity / Gamerunner Documentation
The good news is that Empire should be flexible to configure and fast to run.
The bad news is that you'll have to compile it.
